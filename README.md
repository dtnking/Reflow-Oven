# Reflow-Oven
Reflow oven is used to reflow soldering of surface-mounted electronic components to printed circuit board. Reflow soldering is the mechanism that used to assemble most printed circuit board these days. It enables mass production at a very rapid rate by allowing the placement of components to be separated from the actual soldering process. 

In reflow soldering, the pads of the printed circuit board are first applied with solder paste in a pattern using stencil so that it leaves solder paste only. Solder paste is a mixture of flux and solder which is sticky to allow the component be placed on it and held remain. When all of the components are in place on the printed circuit board, the board is then placed into the reflow oven where it is raised to a temperature above the melting point of the solder. The solder then reflows onto the terminal of the components and allowed to cool. At that point, all the components are attached simulateneously.

Reflowing the solder is an alternative way from hand soldering. When hand soldering, components are being treated individually and applying heat at a same time. By constructing a reflow oven, users are able to fabricate printed circuit board by themselves without sending out their design to fabrication house which will spent a lot of time and money. 

Reflow oven needs to be temperature controlled. Here, TRIAC is used in the system to control the power delivered to the heating element. It involves a lot of power electronics. To heat up the heating elements, it needs large amount of power which involves high voltage and current. Extreme care and safety must at the highest priority. Thus safety circuit is very important to prevent any accident occurs. On the PC side, a GUI for power controlling and temperature monitoring is created.
